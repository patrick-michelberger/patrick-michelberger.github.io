For my time in beautiful Milan I built a little language assistant to improve my Italian skills in the next 6 months. It lets you take a picture of something to hear how to say it in Italian. It’s just one example of what you can make using Google’s machine learning API’s, without needing to dive into the details of machine learning.

I plan to improve the app over the course of my stay abroad. The current code can be found here <a href="https://github.com/patrick-michelberger/babel" target="_blank">https://github.com/patrick-michelberger/babel</a>.
