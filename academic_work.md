           <b>Description:</b>
           The work evaluates potential resource savings, performance improvements and security
           concerns of a content distribution network (CDN) from client web browsers. The
           implementation leverages the WebRTC framework to
           distribute content between peers without relaying the data through an intermediate web
           server. The evaluation exploits a cloud computing infrastructure to access websites from
           automated browser instances located across multiple locations. Furthermore, a proxy
           server is used to inject the system's client component and simulate peer-to-peer content
           delivery with real websites.
